				<p>Salade niçoise is a typical French salad from the Provence region, which can be served as a side dish or a light meal on its own. It’s typically a combination of lettuce, fresh tomatoes, boiled eggs, (canned or fresh) tuna, green beans, Nicoise Cailletier olives and anchovies, although many variations exist.</p>

				<h2>PROCEDURE</h2>
				<ul type="square" style="text-align: left">
				<li>Marinate tuna steaks in a little olive oil for an hour. Heat a large skillet on medium high heat, or place on a hot grill. Cook the steaks 2 to 3 minutes on each side until cooked through.</li>
				<li>Make vinaigrette: In a jar, place the oil, lemon juice or vinegar, shallots, herbs, and mustard. Cover with a lid and shake until well blended. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
				<li>Marinate onion slices in some of the vinaigrette: Place onion slices in a small bowl and sprinkle with 3 Tbsp of the vinaigrette. (The onions soaking in the vinaigrette will help take some of the bite out of them.)</li>
				<li>Cook the potatoes, cut, and dress with vinaigrette: Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with 2 inches of water.  Add 1 Tbsp of salt. Heat on high to bring to a boil. Lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes or so, until the potatoes are fork tender. Drain.
				<br>
				While the potatoes are still warm, cut them into halves or quarters, depending on the size of the potatoes.
				<br>
				Place them in a bowl and dress them with about 1/4 cup of the vinaigrette.</li>
				<li>Boil the green beans in salted water: While the potatoes are cooking, fill a medium sized pot halfway with water, and add 2 teaspoons of salt. Bring to a boil on high heat. Add the green beans to the boiling water.
				<br>
				Cook until tender but still firm to the bite, about 3-5 minutes (more or less, depending on the toughness of the beans).
				<br>
				Drain and either rinse with cold water to stop the cooking, or shock for half a minute in ice water.</li>
				<li> Arrange on a bed of lettuce: Arrange bed of lettuce on a serving platter. Cut tuna into 1/2-inch thick slices. Mound tuna in center of lettuce. Sprinkle the tomatoes and onions around the tuna.
				<br>	
				Arrange the  potatoes and green beans in mounds at the edge of the lettuce.
				<br>
				Arrange hard boiled eggs, olives, and anchovies (if using) in mounds on the lettuce bed.</li>
				<li>Drizzle everything with the remaining vinaigrette. Sprinkle with capers if using.
				<br>
				Serve immediately. Should be served slightly warm or at room temperature.</li>
				</ul>
