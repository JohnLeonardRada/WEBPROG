		<p style="text-align: left;">Squidward J. Q. Tentacles is one of the ten main characters of the SpongeBob SquarePants franchise. He is the neighbor between SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star. He is a turquoise octopus (not a squid) who lives in an Easter Island head. </p>

		<div>
		<p>Squidward works as the cashier of the Krusty Krab, a job he despises. He is a very cynical and selfish individual and displays an unjustified air of superiority.
		
		Squidward also has at least 492 self-portraits in his house and is delusional about his talents, such as playing the clarinet, though almost everyone considers him to be terrible.</p>

		<p>Although his name contains the word "squid," Squidward has been confirmed to be an octopus in many interviews and episodes. In "Feral Friends," his exact species is identified: a giant Pacific octopus. The series' animators believed that giving him eight tentacles would have made him look burdened and would be too difficult to animate, which is why he is normally depicted with six limbs. Notable exceptions are the live-action sequence in "Pressure" and briefly in "Sold!," in which he is seen with eight legs. A squid has ten limbs, unlike Squidward.</p>
